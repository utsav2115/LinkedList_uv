# Singly Linked List Operations in C  

This repository contains a C program that demonstrates various operations on a **Singly Linked List**, a fundamental data structure in computer science. The program is interactive and allows users to perform operations like insertion, deletion, and modification of nodes.

## Features  

- **Node Creation**: Automatically adds nodes during initialization.  
- **Insertion Operations**:  
  - At the beginning of the list.  
  - At the end of the list.  
  - After a specified node.  
- **Deletion Operations**:  
  - From the beginning of the list.  
  - From the end of the list.  
  - Before or after a specified node.  
- **Modify Node Data**: Update the value of a specified node.  
- **Display List**: View the current state of the linked list.  

## Usage  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/utsavvachhani/LinkedListOperations.git
   ```  

2. Compile the program:  
   ```bash
   gcc -o linked_list linked_list.c
   ```  

3. Run the program:  
   ```bash
   ./linked_list
   ```  

4. Follow the interactive menu to perform various operations on the linked list.  

## Example Menu  

- Insert at the beginning or end.  
- Insert after a specific node.  
- Delete the first, last, or specific nodes.  
- Display the list.  
- Modify node data.  

## About  

This program was created as part of my study of **Data Structures** to understand the working of Linked Lists.
